			<h2>About</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>
				insula is a an <em>arcade</em> racing game, meaning it doesn't
				focus on realism. It started as a simple graphics test for
				the <acronym title="spacegameengine">sge</acronym> game engine
				but soon became more than that. <strong>Note</strong> though:
				The game is still a "sandbox" to play with new features, it is
				not supposed to be stable or compatible with older or
				different compilers, architectures or graphics cards!
			</p>

			<h3>Game mode</h3>
			<p>
				The game is supposed to be played in <dfn>hot seat mode</dfn>,
				meaning: It's boring to play alone, yet there's no network
				support and no support for parallel play. So players have to
				take turns.
			</p>

			<h3>Goal</h3>

				<tr><td>
					<img src="nugget.png" alt="Illustration of a nugget in-game"/>
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td>
					<em>Fig. 1: A nugget example</em>
				</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				The goal for each player (they're all competing, no teams!) is
				to drive around the map and collect all "nuggets" as fast as
				possible. Nuggets are randomly placed coins which can be
				collected by driving through them (see fig.1 ). The nugget
				positions are generated <em>once</em>, not for each turn,so no
				player has the advantage of beneficial nugget placement (they
				could be all aligned in a row so you only have to hit the gas
				pedal once, it's random after all). The starting position is
				also the same for each player.
