			<h2><a name="about"></a>About</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>
				insula is a an <em>arcade</em> racing game, meaning it doesn't
				focus on realism. It started as a simple graphics test for
				the <acronym title="spacegameengine">sge</acronym> game engine
				but soon became more than that. <strong>Note</strong> though:
				The game is still a "sandbox" to play with new features, it is
				not supposed to be stable or compatible with older or
				different compilers, architectures or graphics cards!
			</p>

			<h3>Game mode</h3>
			<p>
				The game is supposed to be played in <dfn>hot seat mode</dfn>,
				meaning: It's boring to play alone, yet there's no network
				support and no support for parallel play. So players have to
				take turns.
			</p>

			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<table class="floating_image">
				<tr><td>
					<img src="images/nugget.png" alt="Illustration of a nugget in-game"/>
				</td></tr>
				<tr><td>
					<span class="caption">Fig. 1: A nugget example</span>
				</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				The goal for each player (they're all competing, no teams!) is
				to drive around the map and collect all "nuggets" as fast as
				possible. Nuggets are randomly placed coins which can be
				collected by driving through them (see fig.1). The nugget
				positions are generated <em>once</em>, not for each turn,so no
				player has the advantage of beneficial nugget placement (they
				could be all aligned in a row so you only have to hit the gas
				pedal once, it's random after all). The starting position is
				also the same for each player.

			<h2><a name="getting_it"></a>Getting it</h2>
			<h3>Warning</h3>
				<p>
					Getting insula is not easy and you might not be able to compile it
					at all. Be patient, don't get frustrated, don't panic. :)
				</p>
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<h4>System</h4>
				insula uses <strong>OpenGL-3</strong>, so you need a fairly
				recent graphics card. Also, it's written
				in <strong>C++0x</strong> (see
				the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_0x">Wiki
				article</a> for
				more info), so you need a compiler that
				supports it. Currently,
				only <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"><dfn>&gt;=gcc-4.5</dfn></a>
				is a candidate,
				but <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><dfn>clang</dfn></a> and
				MSVC++-10 might work in the future, too (maybe even now, it's
				untested on those compilers).
			<h4>Libraries</h4>
				<p>
					insula relies on the following "main" libraries:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> &#x2013; an
						essential C++ library (portable)
					</li>
					<li>
						<dfn>sge</dfn> (as mentioned above) &#x2013; the graphics engine,
						currently supporting <em>OpenGL</em> as a graphics
						backend, <em>OpenAL</em> as a sound backend
						and <em>libpng</em> to load images. You will need all of
						those dependencies. <strong>Currently only runs on
						Linux</strong>. Windows support is on the way, though.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.bulletphysics.com/">bullet</a> for the
						physics (portable)
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://fcppt.net"><acronym title="Freundlich's
						C++ toolkit">fcppt</acronym></a> &#x2013; a C++ toolkit,
						similar to boost (which is already a dependency for sge,
						but insula relies heavily on it, too).
					</li>
					<li>
						<dfn>mizuiro</dfn> &#x2013; a templated image processing library
						(already a depenceny for sge), similar (but far superior to) <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/gil/Generic+Image+Library">boost::gil</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Compilation step by step</h3>
			<h4>System</h4>
			<p>
				This installation guide will assume that you
				use <dfn>&gt;=gcc-4.5</dfn>. I will not explain how this is
				installed. It's highly dependant on the
				distribution. To <em>test</em> if you've got the right
				compiler, open a terminal and type:
			</p>
			<p>
				<kbd>gcc --version</kbd>
			</p>
			<p>
				It should output something like this:
			</p>
			<pre>
gcc (Gentoo 4.5.1 p1.0, pie-0.4.5) 4.5.1
Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
			</pre>
			<p>
				As you can see, I'm using gcc-4.5.1
				on <a href="http://gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>. From now on
				I'll assume the right compiler is present.
			</p>
			<p>
				You'll also need <dfn>boost</dfn>. This is included in most
				Linux distributions and it's available on Windows,
				too. Installation is &#x2013; again &#x2013; distribution and
				operating system dependent and I'll not explain it here.
			</p>
			<p>
				You also need <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> to
				download some of the libraries (not all of them are
				downloadable via http). You can download git
				from <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">here</a>. Compiling
				it from source is straightforward: just download, extract, go
				to the directory and do <kbd>./configure --prefix=/tmp &amp;&amp; make
				install</kbd>, assuming you want it installed in
				the <kbd>/tmp/</kbd> directory. git is, however, widely
				available on all operating systems.
			</p>
		<h4>A note about the process</h4>
			I'm assuming you're only interested in trying out insula and you
			don't want permanent or system-wide changes to your Linux
			installation. So we're going to install all of the libraries in
			a separate (and later deletable) directory structure. I'll refer
			to the root of that directory structure as <code>ROOT</code>
			from now on. For example, insula will be located
			in <code>ROOT/insula</code>, sge will be installed
			in <code>ROOT/include/sge</code>, <code>ROOT/lib</code> and so
			on. 
		<h4>fcppt</h4>
		<p>
			Installation instructions for fcppt are already
			available <a href="http://fcppt.net/fcppt_/requirements__download_and_installation.html">here</a>
			but I'll explain it again here. Just for consistency.
		</p>
		<p>
			FIXME
			Get the latest version of fcppt either from the installation
			instruction page (see above) or from git using the
			command <kbd>git clone
			git://timeout.supraverse.net/fcppt.git</kbd>. This, of course,
			assumes that you have git installed. You end up with a
